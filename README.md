# Infant Mortality Rate project replication
### Jan Dudzik Jarosław Leski Michał Kunstler, June 2023
#### Reproducible Research class final project supervised by of prof. Wojciech Hardy and Łukasz Nawaro

The project aim was to replicate the project about infant mortality rate across countries, which was originally written
in R language during our bachelor studies. The source file was reconsidered using acquired programming knowledge, 
optimized and rewritten within new environment.

The project consists of several parts:

 - [Source files](https://github.com/michal-kunstler/RR_project_JD_JR_MK/tree/main/Source%20files)
    repository with files used in the original project
    - [PDF with original project](https://github.com/michal-kunstler/RR_project_JD_JR_MK/blob/main/Source%20files/Leski_Model_Śmiertelność%20.pdf)
